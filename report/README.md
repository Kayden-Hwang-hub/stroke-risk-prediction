### `01_data_cleaning_and_eda.qmd`
This Quarto file performs and documents:

- Initial dataset loading and formatting
- Type conversion of numeric and categorical variables
- Missing data inspection and visualization
- Summary statistics for numeric variables
- Visual exploration of key predictors (e.g., BMI, glucose level)
- Class imbalance check of the target variable (`stroke`)
- Imputation of missing values using:
  - Median imputation for `bmi`
  - A new `"Missing"` level for `smoking_status`
- A final data dictionary summarizing cleaned variables

This file prepares a finalized, clean dataset ready for training a neural network model.

Future reports (e.g., model training, evaluation) will be added here as additional `.qmd` files.
